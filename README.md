Welcome to my notesApp, use of this app is pretty simple, there's a form for a new note and there is only one user, the current user. You type in your note title and content and click "Create Note!" and asynchronously you'll see your note displayed on the page. Adversely you can select "Delete" to get rid of your newly created or any previously created notes, the note can be a string, an img_url, a link, and if you click the user icon in the top left you can make the form invisible. 

The only additional features I wanted to work into this app was a dropdown to select the month/week/year which would then allow you 7 notes for the week so kind of like an agenda or planner idea. The notes would all show up in the bottom center rather than centered on the page as it is now. If you selected a different month/week/year it would show you the 7 notes you made for that week, I assume I could probably make that happen with a .map. 

Aside from that maybe a text editor feature you see on most sites where you can make your text bold or italicized, change the size, add bullet points etc.
